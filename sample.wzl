# Define data vectors
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
y = [5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23]

# Calculate some statistics
sum_x = vec_average(x)
max_y = vec_max(y)
min_x = vec_min(x)

# Perform vector operations
z = x + y
w = x * 2
v = y / 2

# Apply a moving average with window size 3
moving_avg = vec_average(y, 3)

# Create a basic line plot
plot(x, y)

# Create a scatter plot
scatter(x, z)

# Create a histogram of values
histogram(y, 5)

# Perform clustering on the data
combined = [x, y]
clusters = clustering(combined, 2)

# Output the final results
print(result)
